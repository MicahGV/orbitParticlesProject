# orbitParticlesProject
A fun little gravity project that I made with html5 canvas and some ES6 javascript.

It was created through using [Cowell's Method]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_modeling#Cowell's_method") of orbital modeling simulation.

It has been slightly modified to not deal with numbers with factors of 10^20 or so. So, there is no gravitational constant involved
and instead of the distances being cubed I went with the distance just being squared. Most of the modifications came out from just playing around with the method and seeing what looked good.
